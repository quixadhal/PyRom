Hello.

This package is the networking modules (async.py and telnet.py) from the
Python based MUD I've been working on.  I've had a couple folks ask if I
would be willing to release them under a more permissive license than the
GPL.  While I believe in the GPL for growing a community around a project,
but I also understand the appeal of non-copyleft for maximum flexibility
with regards to support modules.  I removed all the non-network dependencies,
cleaned up the code a bit, re-licensed it, and added a small chat server to
demo it in action.  Please note that the Apache 2.0 license only applies to
these three files (given the chaotic state of the MUD, you're not missing
much).

I wanted to use the Python License but, apparently, that is designed for use
only by the Python Software Foundation.  Their FAQ page listed the Apache 2.0
license as compatible so I'm using that instead.

Please note that I have not tested these modules under Windows -- it being
all icky and stuff.  I would appreciate any fixes you find necessary.

Enjoy Miniboa and please let me know if you build anything cool.

Regards,
Jim Storch
